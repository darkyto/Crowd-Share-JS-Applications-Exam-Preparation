Crowd Share â€“ Web Client
Practical exam JavaScript Applications - 29 July 2014

You are given server logic in the form of a REST API in Node.js, which implements the Crowd Share. Your task is to develop a client-side application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (+jQuery), that uses (consumes) these services, to allow users to share their posts, using their web browser.

The server is started through the app.js script from Node (you need first to install the dependencies) or by starting the commands start-server.txt file.

The server is available locally on your computer or online here: http://jsapps.bgcoder.com
